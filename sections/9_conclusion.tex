\section{Conclusions}

We presented SCORE, a novel SOCP relaxation of the RA-SLAM problem. Through
simulated and real-world experiments we demonstrated SCORE outperforms
state-of-the-art initialization techniques and can obtain high-quality
initializations for RA-SLAM problems. The initializations provided by SCORE
resulted in up to two orders of magnitude reduction in average pose error when
compared to existing odometry-based initializations. Notably, we showed that
SCORE can determine good initializations for the challenging multi-robot RA-SLAM
problem when using only odometry and inter-robot range measurements. Along the
way, we derived a QCQP formulation of the RA-SLAM problem, which is of
independent scientific interest and connects RA-SLAM to a broader body of work.
Finally, we discussed empirically-derived hypotheses as to the conditions under
which SCORE can be expected to return a good initialization and drew connections
to existing theoretical analysis in SNL.
