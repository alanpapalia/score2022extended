\section{Notation and Mathematical Preliminaries}


\textbf{Symbols:} This work generalizes across dimensionalities (e.g., 2-D or
3-D). As such the mathematical presentation will assume to be working in
$d$-dimensional space.  We denote the $d$-dimensional identity matrix as $I_d$
and the special orthogonal group as $\SOd$. We refer to the set of real values
as $\R$ and the set of nonnegative reals as $\RnonNeg$. Furthermore, we indicate vectors and
scalars with lowercase symbols (e.g., $\tran$) and matrices with uppercase
symbols (e.g.,  $\rot$). Noisy measurements are indicated with a tilde (e.g.,
$\nrot$). The true (latent) value of a quantity will be underlined (e.g.,
$\trot$)

\textbf{Mathematical Operators:} We denote the matrix trace as $\tr (\cdot)$. A
diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $[a_1, \ldots, a_n]$ is indicated as
$\diag ([a_1, \ldots, a_n])$. The vector 2-norm is indicated as $\|
\cdot \|_2$ and the Frobenius norm is indicated as $\| \cdot \|_F$. We
note the following relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operators:
$\| A \|_F^2 = \tr(A A^\top) = \tr(A^\top A)$.

\textbf{Probability Distributions:} We indicate a Gaussian probability
distribution over Euclidean space, with mean $\mu \in \dvec$ and variance
$\Sigma \in \dmat$ as $\gaussian (\mu, \Sigma)$. Similarly, we denote the
isotropic Langevin probability distribution\IsotropicLangevinFootnote over
matrix elements of the special orthogonal group, $\SOd$, with mode $\rot_\mu \in
\dmat$ and concentration parameter $\kappa \in \R$ as $\langevin (\rot_\mu,
\kappa)$ \cite{chiuso08infosys}.
This is the distribution whose probability density function is:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:langevin-distribution}
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \prot \sim \text{Langevin}(\rot_\mu, \kappa) \\ \prob( \prot )
        = \frac{1}{c(\kappa)} \exp\{\kappa \tr (\rot_\mu^\top
        \prot)\}
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
with normalizing constant $c(\kappa)$.
