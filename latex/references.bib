%
% - don't trust citeseer:
%     make sure any information that goes in here is correct (papers might
%     not have been accepted!); instead check with ACM, IEEE etc (Google
%     usually provides those links, so it's very easy to do). You don't want
%     wrong citations in your paper submissions and theses!
%
% - abbreviate first names for "author" fields
%     for full first names use the optional "fullauthor" field
%
% - month is a 3 letter abbreviation, all lowercase
%     jan, feb, mar, apr... Automatic typesetting based on bst style file
%
% - don't use {{}} for the title
%     as it prevents latex from correctly formatting the entry:
%       {{Toward AUV Survey Design for Optimal Coverage and
%         localization using the Cramer Rao Lower Bound}}
%     the correct version is:
%        {Toward {AUV} Survey Design for Optimal Coverage and
%         Localization using the {C}ramer {R}ao Lower Bound}
%     which forces "AUV" to be upper case, while "Survey" will automatically
%     be formatted upper or lower case according to the bibtex style in use
%
% - if possible, use emacs to format/sort
%     see menu BibTeX-Edit, "Operating on Buffer or oRegion",
%     (this is "M-x bibtex-sort-buffer" from non GUI emacs)
%   OR
%     if you don't use emacs, manually insert the entry in the correct
%     place, alphabetically (formatting is less important, but sorting helps
%     avoid svn conflicts when multiple people make changes.
%     commit changes immediately to avoid this)
%
% - avoid duplicate entries
%     one more reason to sort!

  abstract        = {Autonomous agents deployed or moving on land for the purpose of carrying out coordinated tasks need to have good knowledge of their absolute or relative position. For large formations, it is often impractical to equip each agent with an absolute sensor such as GPS, whereas relative range sensors measuring interagent distances are cheap and commonly available. In this setting, this paper considers the problem of autonomous distributed estimation of the position of each agent in a networked formation using noisy measurements of interagent distances. The underlying geometrical problem has been studied quite extensively in various fields, ranging from molecular biology to robotics, and it is known to lead to a hard nonconvex optimization problem. Centralized algorithms do exist that work reasonably well in finding local or global minimizers for this problem (e.g., semidefinite programming relaxations). Here, we explore a fully decentralized approach for localization from range measurements, and we propose a computational scheme based on a distributed gradient algorithm with Barzilai-Borwein stepsizes. The advantage of this distributed approach is that each agent may autonomously compute its position estimate, exchanging information only with its neighbors, without need of communicating with a central station and without needing complete knowledge of the network structure. {\textcopyright} 1996-2012 IEEE.},

               robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously

               approaches as a viable alternative to extended
               Kalman filter-based solutions to the problem. In
               particular, we look at approaches that factorize
               either the associated information matrix or the
               measurement matrix into square root form. Such
               techniques have several significant advantages over
               the EKF: they are faster yet exact, they can be used

               equipped to deal with non-linear process and
               measurement models, and yield the entire robot
               trajectory, at lower cost. In addition, in an
               indirect but dramatic way, column ordering
               heuristics automatically exploit the locality
               inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM
               problem. In this paper we present the theory
               underlying these methods, an interpretation of
               factorization in terms of the graphical model
               associated with the SLAM problem, and simulation
               results that underscore the potential of these
               methods for use in practice.}

                robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously
                unknown environment. We investigate smoothing
                approaches as a viable alternative to extended
                Kalman filter-based solutions to the problem. In
                particular, we look at approaches that factorize
                either the associated information matrix or the
                measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such
                techniques have several significant advantages over
                the EKF: they are faster yet exact, they can be used
                in either batch or incremental mode, are better
                equipped to deal with non-linear process and
                measurement models, and yield the entire robot
                trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of SLAM
                problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic
                way, column ordering heuristics automatically
                exploit the locality inherent in the geographic
                nature of the SLAM problem. In this paper we present
                the theory underlying these methods, along with an
                interpretation of factorization in terms of the
                graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. We
                present both simulation results and actual SLAM
                experiments in large-scale environments that
                underscore the potential of these methods as an
                alternative to EKF-based approaches.}

                collected over an extended duration by a Willow
                Garage PR2 robot in the 10 story MIT Stata
                Center. As of September 2012 the dataset comprises
                over 2.3 TB, 38 h and 42 km (the length of a
                marathon). The dataset is of particular interest to
                robotics and computer vision researchers interested
                in long-term autonomy. It is expected to be useful
                in a variety of research areas - robotic mapping
                (long-term, visual, RGB-D or laser), change
                detection in indoor environments, human pattern
                analysis, long-term path planning. For ease of use
                the original ROS ‘bag’ log files are provided and
                also a derivative version combining human readable
                data and imagery in standard formats. Of particular
                importance, this dataset also includes ground-truth
                position estimates of the robot at every instance
                (to typical accuracy of 2 cm) using as-built
                floor-plans - which were carefully extracted using
                our software tools. The provision of ground-truth
                for such a large dataset enables more meaningful
                comparison between algorithms than has previously
                been possible.}

                 maps of an unknown environment while concurrently
                 using these maps for navigation. Current algorithms
                 for this concurrent mapping and localization (CML)
                 problem have been implemented for single vehicles,
                 but do not account for extra positional information
                 available when multiple vehicles operate
                 simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential
                 to map an environment more quickly and robustly than
                 a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative
                 CML algorithm that merges sensor and navigation
                 information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The
                 algorithm presented is based on stochastic
                 estimation and uses a feature-based approach to
                 extract landmarks from the environment. The
                 theoretical framework for the collaborative CML
                 algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem
                 central to the cooperative CML problem is proved for
                 the first time. This theorem quantifies the
                 performance gains of collaboration, allowing for
                 determination of the number of cooperating vehicles
                 required to accomplish a task. A simulated
                 implementation of the collaborative CML algorithm
                 demonstrates substantial performance improvement
                 over non-cooperative CML.},

@article{Fischell2020,
  abstract = {Swarms of robots are starting to appear in aerial and ground robotics across multiple operational domains: be it for search-and-rescue mapping, or Olympic light shows, controlled groups of drones are able to be coordinated in groups. This capability does not currently extend to the underwater domain, for a reason of basic physics: the attenuation of light in water is 10 orders of magnitude greater than that in air, rendering ineffective the navigation and communication technologies used in terrestrial robotics. Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is either expensive or unwieldy, requiring high-power sensors such as inertial navigation sensors (INS) that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, frequent surfacing for GPS, or the deployment of geo-located acoustic beacons, limiting the operational area which is a severe constraint given the scale of oceanographic sensing. To do swarms of underwater vehicles will require a navigation and communication scheme that allows vehicles to remain together in an area while prosecuting a mission without these constraints. This paper suggests a system that would make underwater swarming possible by using single-transducer, Doppler-based and multi-frequency attenuation-based acoustic navigation without time-synchronization for multi-vehicle swarming. In this solution, a leader with good navigation carries a multi-frequency sound source. Scalable numbers of followers equipped with a custom low-cost acoustic package then adapt heading based on Doppler-shifted frequency and range using multi-frequency difference in absorption. In this paper, the theory behind this technique is presented and tested under different simulation conditions. Design of a prototype low-cost system is also described.},

                   robustness to data association errors. Another
                   important advantage of our algorithm is that
                   non-linearities are computed exactly, so that global
                   constraints can be imposed even if they result in
                   large shifts to the map. We represent the map as a
                   graph and use the graph to find an efficient map
                   update algorithm. We also show how topological
                   consistency can be imposed on the map, such as,
                   closing a loop. The algorithm has been implemented
                   on an outdoor robot and we have experimental
                   validation of our ideas. We also explain how the
                   graph can be simplified leading to linear
                   approximations of sections of the map. This
                   reduction gives us a natural way to connect local

  abstract   = {This paper presents a statistical algorithm for
                collaborative mobile robot localization. Our
                approach uses a sample-based version of Markov
                localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in
                an any-time fashion.  When teams of robots localize
                themselves in the same environment, probabilistic
                methods are employed to synchronize each robot's
                belief whenever one robot detects another. As a
                result, the robots localize themselves faster,
                maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are
                amortized across multiple robot platforms. The
                technique has been implemented and tested using two
                mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser
                range-finders for detecting other robots. The
                results, obtained with the real robots and in series
                of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements
                in localization speed and accuracy when compared to
                conventional single-robot localization. A further
                experiment demonstrates that under certain
                conditions, successful localization is only possible
                if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during
                localization.},
  c-been     = {Sensor : camera and laser use detection model to
                model the robots' abilities to recognize each other.
                summary : Use a factorial representation where each
                robot maintains its own, local belief function, to
                avoid exponential complexity in the number of
                robots.  Sampling based scheme is employed to
                approximate beliefs.  Global localization(all robot
                can localize temselves from scratch without initial
                knowldege as to where they are) Transforms
                detections into density trees, which approximate
                discrete sample sets by piecewise constant density
                functions. These trees are used to refine the
                weighting factors of other robots' beliefs, reducing
                their uncertainty.  This paper doesn't really care
                about mapping by the way.  Limitation : Assume that
                if a robot detect another robot, it know which one
                it is Not taking into account negative information
                This sample based method is not robust for high
                false positive rates.  Usefulness : in related work
                session, it mentions how previous approaches are
                limited. might be useful for our paper. }

  abstract   = {This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous
                localisation and mapping (SLAM) by a mobile
                robot. An incremental SLAM algorithm is introduced
                that is derived from multigrid methods used for
                solving partial differential equations. The approach
                improves on the performance of previous relaxation
                methods for robot mapping because it optimizes the
                map at multiple levels of resolution. The resulting
                algorithm has an update time that is linear in the

  abstract   = {In 2006, Olson et al. presented a novel approach to
                address the graph-based simultaneous localization
                and mapping problem by applying stochastic gradient
                descent to minimize the error introduced by
                constraints. Together with multi-level relaxation,
                this is one of the most robust and efficient maximum
                likelihood techniques published so far. In this
                paper, we present an extension of Olson's
                algorithm. It applies a novel parameterization of
                the nodes in the graph that significantly improves
                the performance and enables us to cope with
                arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us
                to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size
                of the mapped area and not to the length of the
                trajectory as it is the case with both previous
                approaches. We implemented our technique and
                compared it to multi-level relaxation and Olson?
                algorithm. As we demonstrate in simulated and in
                real world experiments, our approach converges
                faster than the other approaches and yields accurate
                maps of the environment.},
  c-kaess    = {Solves a problem that only appears with iterative
                batch solvers. Improves Olson06icra, which uses
                stochastic gradient descent and relative coordinates
                for fast updates. In contrast to Olson06icra, which
                represents nodes relative to their successors in the
                trajectory, a spanning tree over the nodes is
                created, and nodes represented relative to their
                parents. This reduces updates for loops to one
                ascending and one descending tree traversal.}

  abstract  = {The problem of generating maps with mobile robots
               has received considerable attention over the past
               years. However, most of the approaches assume that
               the environment is static during the
               data-acquisition phase. In this paper we consider
               the problem of creating maps with mobile robots in
               populated environments. Our approach uses a
               probabilistic method to track multiple people and to
               incorporate the results of the tracking technique
               into the mapping process. The resulting maps are
               more accurate since corrupted readings are treated
               accordingly during the matching phase and since the
               number of spurious objects in the resulting maps is
               reduced. Our approach has been implemented and
               tested on real robot systems in indoor and outdoor
               scenarios. We present several experiments
               illustrating the capabilities of our approach to
               generate accurate 2D and 3D maps.}

                unique and challenging application of robotics. The
                problem poses rich questions in physical design and
                operation, perception and navigation, and planning,
                driven by difficulties arising from the acoustic
                environment, poor water quality and the highly
                complex structures to be inspected. In this paper,
                we develop and apply algorithms for the central
                navigation and planning problems on ship
                hulls. These divide into two classes, suitable for
                the open, forward parts of a typical monohull, and
                for the complex areas around the shafting,
                propellers and rudders. On the open hull, we have
                integrated acoustic and visual mapping processes to
                achieve closed-loop control relative to features
                such as weld-lines and biofouling. In the complex
                area, we implemented new large-scale planning
                routines so as to achieve full imaging coverage of
                all the structures, at a high resolution. We
                demonstrate our approaches in recent operations on
                naval ships.}

  abstract   = {This paper describes a novel representation for
                two-dimensional maps, and shows how this
                representation may be applied to the problem of
                multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping. We
                are inspired by the notion of a manifold, which
                takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto
                a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional
                space. The key advantage of the manifold
                representation is selfconsistency: when closing
                loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the "cross
                over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This
                self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of
                important capabilities, including autonomous
                exploration, search, and retro-traverse. It also
                supports a very robust form of loop closure, in
                which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm or
                reject possible correspondence points. In this
                paper, we develop the basic formalism of the
                manifold representation, show how this may be
                applied to the multirobot simultaneous localization
                and mapping problem, and present experimental
                results obtained from teams of up to four robots in
                environments ranging in size from 400 to 900 m2.},

                key motivation in designing this representation is
                to support autonomous behaviors .. algorithm is
                centralized Delayed updates (loop closing, island
                merging is possible), which makes the current map
                possible to use for planning.. (if it moves circle
                environment, it becomes spiral untill loop is
                closed) island mergine = loop closure, pretty
                much.. }

  abstract   = {This paper describes an on-line algorithm for
                multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping
                (SLAM). The starting point is the single-robot
                Rao-Blackwellized particle filter described by
                Hhnel et al., and three key generalizations are
                made. First, the particle filter is extended to
                handle multi-robot SLAM problems in which the
                initial pose of the robots is known (such as occurs
                when all robots start from the same
                location). Second, an approximation is introduced to
                solve the more general problem in which the initial
                pose of robots is not known a priori (such as occurs
                when the robots start from widely separated
                locations). In this latter case, it is assumed that
                pairs of robots will eventually encounter one
                another, thereby determining their relative
                pose. This relative attitude is used to initialize
                the filter, and subsequent observations from both
                robots are combined into a common map. Third and
                finally, a method is introduced to integrate
                observations collected prior to the first robot
                encounter, using the notion of a virtual robot
                travelling backwards in time. This novel approach
                allows one to integrate all data from all robots
                into a single common map.},
  c-been     = {Assumption is that robots are able to detect,
                identify and measure the relative pose of other
                robots at some time during the exploration
                task. Only the first such encounter is used:
                subsequent encounters between robots are
                ignored. Also assumed that the filter supports
                time-reversed updates - called 'virtual' robots
                travelling backwards in time. It will be good to
                compare their approach to ours. It is different and
                similar in certain ways.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new local submap joining
               algorithm for building large-scale feature based
               maps. The algorithm is based on the recently
               developed Sparse Local Submap Joining Fil- ter
               (SLSJF) and uses multiple iterations to im- prove
               the estimate and hence is called Iterated SLSJF
               (I-SLSJF). The input to the I-SLSJF algorithm is a
               sequence of local submaps. The output of the
               algorithm is a global map con- taining the global
               positions of all the features as well as all the
               robot start/end poses of the local submaps. In the
               submap joining step of I-SLSJF, when- ever the
               change of state estimate computed by an Extended
               Information Filter (EIF) is larger than a predened
               threshold, the information vector and the
               information matrix is recom- puted as a sum of all
               the local map contribu- tions. This improves the
               accuracy of the esti- mate as well as avoids the
               possibility that the Jacobian with respect to the
               same feature gets evaluated at dierent estimate
               values, which is one of the major causes of
               inconsistency for EIF/EKF algorithms. Although the
               computa- tional cost of I-SLSJF is higher than that
               of SLSJF, the algorithm can still be implemented
               eciently due to the exactly sparseness of the
               information matrix. The new algorithm is com- pared
               with EKF SLAM and SLSJF using both computer
               simulation and experimental exam- ples. }

                navigation for underwater vehicles performing harbor
                surveillance and ship hull inspection. Maintaining
                accurate localization for the duration of a mission
                is important for a variety of tasks, such as
                planning the vehicle trajectory and ensuring
                coverage of the area to be inspected. Our approach
                only uses onboard sensors in a simultaneous
                localization and mapping setting and removes the
                need for any external infrastructure like acoustic
                beacons.We extract dense features from a
                forwardlooking imaging sonar and apply pair-wise
                registration between sonar frames. The registrations
                are combined with onboard velocity, attitude and
                acceleration sensors to obtain an improved estimate
                of the vehicle trajectory. We show results from
                several experiments that demonstrate drift-free
                navigation in various underwater environments.}

  abstract   = {In this paper, we demonstrate a system for
                temporally scalable visual SLAM using a reduced pose
                graph representation. Unlike previous visual SLAM
                approaches that use keyframes, our approach
                continually uses new measurements to improve the
                map, yet achieves efficiency by avoiding adding
                redundant frames and not using marginalization to
                reduce the graph. To evaluate our approach, we
                present results using an online binocular visual
                SLAM system that uses place recognition for both
                robustness and multi-session operation. To allow
                large-scale indoor mapping, our system automatically
                handles elevator rides based on accelerometer
                data. We demonstrate long-term mapping in a large
                multi-floor building, using approximately nine hours
                of data collected over the course of six months. Our
                results illustrate the capability of our visual SLAM
                system to scale in size with the area of exploration
                instead of the time of exploration.}

                has received much attention over the last
                years. Especially large scale environments, where
                the robot trajectory loops back on itself, are a
                challenge. In this paper we introduce a new solution
                to this problem of closing the loop. Our algorithm
                is EM-based, but differs from previous work. The key
                is a probability distribution over partitions of
                feature tracks that is determined in the E-step,
                based on the current estimate of the motion. This
                virtual structure is then used in the M-step to
                obtain a better estimate for the motion. We
                demonstrate the success of our algorithm in
                experiments on real laser data.}

                 graphical model inference and sparse linear
                 algebra. The proposed data structure provides a new
                 perspective on an entire class of simultaneous
                 localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Similar
                 to a junction tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored
                 probability density, but unlike the junction tree it
                 is directed and maps more naturally to the square
                 root information matrix of the SLAM problem. This
                 makes it eminently suited to encode the sparse
                 nature of the problem, especially in a smoothing and
                 mapping (SAM) context. The inherent sparsity of SAM
                 has already been exploited in the literature to
                 produce efficient solutions in both batch and online
                 mapping. The graphical model perspective allows us
                 to develop a novel incremental algorithm that
                 seamlessly incorporates reordering and
                 relinearization. This obviates the need for
                 expensive periodic batch operations from previous
                 approaches, which negatively affect the performance
                 and detract from the intended online nature of the
                 algorithm. The new method is evaluated using
                 simulated and real-world datasets in both landmark
                 and pose SLAM settings.}

                inference algorithms and their connection to sparse
                matrix factorization methods.  Similar to a clique
                tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability

                structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better
                understanding of batch matrix factorization in terms
                of probability densities. Second, we show how the
                fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization
                translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and
                its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes
                tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for
                sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, that
                combines incremental updates with fluid
                relinearization of a reduced set of variables for
                efficiency, combined with fast convergence to the
                exact solution. We also present a novel strategy for
                incremental variable reordering to retain
                sparsity.We evaluate our algorithm on standard
                datasets in both landmark and pose SLAM settings.}

                version of incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM).
                iSAM2 is based on a novel graphical model-based
                interpretation of incremental sparse matrix
                factorization methods, afforded by the recently
                introduced Bayes tree data structure. The original
                iSAM algorithm incrementally maintains the square
                root information matrix by applying matrix
                factorization updates.  We analyze the matrix
                updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes
                tree and the conditional densities represented by
                its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a
                method to incrementally change the variable ordering
                which has a large effect on efficiency. We also
                introduce fluid relinearization, the concept of
                selectively relinearizing variables as needed, to
                obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any
                need for periodic batch steps.We analyze the

                show on various real and simulated datasets that the

While traditional algorithms often suffer from either local minima or non-optimality-or a combination of both-we pursue the goal of achieving global solutions of the statistically optimal cost-function. Our approach is based on a hierarchy of convex relaxations to solve non-convex optimization problems with polynomials. These convex relaxations generate a monotone sequence of lower bounds and we show how one can detect whether the global optimum is attained at a given relaxation. The technique is applied to a number of classical vision problems: triangulation, camera pose, homography estimation and last, but not least, epipolar geometry estimation. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data is provided. In practice, only a few relaxations are needed for attaining the global optimum. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a practical method for finding the provably globally optimal solution to numerous problems in projective geometry including multiview triangulation, camera resectioning and homography estimation. Unlike traditional methods which may get trapped in local minima due to the non-convex nature of these problems, this approach provides a theoretical guarantee of global optimality. The formulation relies on recent developments in fractional programming and the theory of convex underestimators and allows a unified framework for minimizing the standard L 2-norm of reprojection errors which is optimal under Gaussian noise as well as the more robust L 1-norm which is less sensitive to outliers. Even though the worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential, the practical efficacy is empirically demonstrated by good performance on experiments for both synthetic and real data. An open source MATLAB toolbox that implements the algorithm is also made available to facilitate further research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract   = {This paper describes a new algorithm for cooperative
                and persistent simultaneous localization and mapping
                (SLAM) using multiple robots. Recent pose graph
                representations have proven very successful for
                single robot mapping and localization. Among these
                methods, incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM)
                gives an exact incremental solution to the SLAM
                problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization
                problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a
                novel extension to iSAM to facilitate online
                multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose
                graphs. Our main contribution is a relative
                formulation of the relationship between multiple
                pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem
                and leads to an efficient solution when compared to
                a completely global formulation.  The relative pose
                graphs are optimized together to provide a globally
                consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient access to
                covariances at any time for relative parameters is
                provided through iSAM, facilitating data association
                and loop closing.  The performance of the technique
                is illustrated on various data sets including a
                publicly available multi-robot data set.  Further
                evaluation is performed in a collaborative
                helicopter and ground robot experiment.}

  abstract  = {An important assumption underlying virtually all
               approaches to multi-robot exploration is prior
               knowledge about their relative locations.  This is
               due to the fact that robots need to merge their maps
               so as to coordinate their exploration
               strategies. The key step in map merging is to
               estimate the relative locations of the individual
               robots. This paper presents a novel approach to
               multi-robot map merging under global uncertainty
               abou t the robot's relative locations. Our approach
               uses an adapted version of particle filters to
               estimate the position of one robot in the other
               robot's partial map. The risk of false-positive map
               matches is avoided by verifying match hypotheses
               using a rendezvous approach. We show how to
               seamlessly integrate this approach into a
               decision-theoretic multi-robot coordination
               strategy. The experiments show that our sample-based
               technique can reliably find good hypotheses for map
               matches. Furthermore, we present results obtained
               with two robots successfully merging their maps
               using the decision- theoretic rendezvous strategy. },
  c-been    = {attempt Initailization problem,each robot builds its
               own gloal map, while continuously estimating the
               pose of the other robot in that map. When this pose

               assumptions about the environment, or by learning

  abstract = {Algorithms that must deal with complicated global
              functions of many variables often exploit the manner
              in which the given functions factor as a product of
              `local' functions, each of which depends on a subset
              of the variables. Such a factorization can be
              visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a
              factor graph. In this tutorial paper, we present a
              generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product
              algorithm, that operates in a factor
              graph. Following a single, simple computational
              rule, the sum-product algorithm computes---either
              exactly or approximately---various marginal
              functions derived from the global function. A wide
              variety of algorithms developed in artificial
              intelligence, signal processing, and digital
              communications can be derived as specific instances
              of the sum-product algorithm, including the
              forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm,
              the iterative `turbo' decoding algorithm, Pearl's
              belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks,
              the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier
              transform (FFT) algorithms.}

  abstract        = {When nodes in a mobile network use relative noisy measurements with respect to their neighbors to estimate their positions, the overall connectivity and geometry of the measurement network has a critical influence on the achievable localization accuracy. This paper considers the problem of deploying a mobile robotic network implementing a cooperative localization scheme based on range measurements only, while attempting to maintain a network geometry that is favorable to estimating the robots' positions with high accuracy. The quality of the network geometry is measured by a 'localizability' function serving as potential field for robot motion planning. This function is built from the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, which provides for a given geometry a lower bound on the covariance matrix achievable by any unbiased position estimator that the robots might implement using their relative measurements. We describe gradient descent-based motion planners for the robots that attempt to optimize or constrain different variations of the network's localizability function, and discuss ways of implementing these controllers in a distributed manner. Finally, the paper also establishes formal connections between our statistical point of view and maintaining a form of weighted rigidity for the graph capturing the relative range measurements.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, we establish global optimality conditions for quadratic optimization problems with quadratic equality and bivalent constraints. We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for a global minimizer of quadratic optimization problems with quadratic equality and bivalent constraints. Then we examine situations where this optimality condition is equivalent to checking the positive semidefiniteness of a related matrix, and so, can be verified in polynomial time by using elementary eigenvalues decomposition techniques. As a consequence, we also present simple sufficient global optimality conditions, which can be verified by solving a linear matrix inequality problem, extending several known sufficient optimality conditions in the existing literature. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

              observations from an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
              and visual sensors, such that initial conditions of
              the inertial integration, including gravity
              estimation, can be recovered quickly and in a linear
              manner, thus removing any need for special
              initialization procedures. The algorithm is
              implemented using a graphical simultaneous
              localization and mapping like approach that
              guarantees constant time output. This paper
              discusses the technical aspects of the work,
              including observability and the ability for the
              system to estimate scale in real time. Results are
              presented of the system, estimating the platforms
              position, velocity, and attitude, as well as gravity
              vector and sensor alignment and calibration on-line
              in a built environment. This paper discusses the
              system setup, describing the real-time integration
              of the IMU data with either stereo or monocular
              vision data. We focus on human motion for the
              purposes of emulating high-dynamic motion, as well
              as to provide a localization system for future
              human-robot interaction.}

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can potentially make these tasks more inexpensive and reliable compared to conventional methods that involve the use of divers and remotely operated vehicles. This paper proposes a robust and practical self-localization method for an underwater vehicle navigating around jacket structures, where the performance of conventional acoustic positioning suffers from multipath degradation. The key idea is to stochastically update the vehicle's horizontal position and heading relative to the structures using two types of perceptional sensors, sonar and camera, assuming that the configuration of the structure is known. The performance of the method was verified with tank experiments using a jacket mock-up and the AUV Tri-Dog 1.},

  abstract   = {This paper describes a system for performing
                real-time multi-session visual mapping in
                large-scale environments. Multi-session mapping
                considers the problem of combining the results of
                multiple simultaneous localisation and mapping
                (SLAM) missions performed repeatedly over time in
                the same environment. The goal is to robustly
                combine multiple maps in a common metrical
                coordinate system, with consistent estimates of
                uncertainty. Our work employs incremental smoothing
                and mapping (iSAM) as the underlying SLAM state
                estimator and uses an improved appearance-based
                method for detecting loop closures within single
                mapping sessions and across multiple sessions. To
                stitch together pose graph maps from multiple visual
                mapping sessions, we employ spatial separator
                variables, called anchor nodes, to link together
                multiple relative pose graphs.  The system
                architecture consists of a separate front-end for
                computing visual odometry and windowed bundle
                adjustment on individual sessions, in conjunction
                with a back-end for performing the place recognition
                and multi-session mapping. We provide experimental
                results for real-time multi- session visual mapping
                on wheeled and handheld datasets in the MIT Stata
                Center. These results demonstrate key capabilities
                that will serve as a foundation for future work in
                large-scale persistent visual mapping.}

                rodents in creating useable maps of their
                environments. Both must learn about their
                environments through experience, and in doing so
                face similar problems dealing with ambiguous and
                noisy information from their sensory
                inputs. Navigation research using robots has
                determined that uncertainty can be effectively
                addressed by maintaining multiple probabilistic
                estimates of a robot's pose. Neural recordings from
                navigating rats have revealed cells with grid-like
                spatial firing properties in the entorhinal cortex
                region of the rodent brain. Here we show how a robot
                equipped with conjunctive grid-cell-like cells can
                maintain multiple estimates of pose and solve a
                navigation task in an environment with no uniquely
                identifying cues. We propose that grid cells in the
                entorhinal cortex provide a similar ability for
                rodents. Robotics has learned much from biological
                systems. In a complementary way, in this study our
                understanding of neural systems is enhanced by
                insights from engineered solutions to a common
                problem faced by mobile robots and navigating
                animals.</p> }

               problem of generating valid maps for dynamic indoor

               preserving only one value for each cell as in the
               common occupancy grid case). By searching for
               similar time series, we can detect moving objects
               that appear only in a limited number of possible
               configurations (e.g. doors or chairs). Simulated
               experiments demonstrate the potentialities of the
               proposed system.}

@article{Moore2004,
  abstract        = {This paper describes a distributed, linear-time algorithm for localizing sensor network nodes in the presence of range measurement noise and demonstrates the algorithm on a physical network. We introduce the probabilistic notion of robust quadrilaterals as a way to avoid flip ambiguities that otherwise corrupt localization computations. We formulate the localization problem as a two-dimensional graph realization problem: given a planar graph with approximately known edge lengths, recover the Euclidean position of each vertex up to a global rotation and translation. This formulation is applicable to the localization of sensor networks in which each node can estimate the distance to each of its neighbors, but no absolute position reference such as GPS or fixed anchor nodes is available. We implemented the algorithm on a physical sensor network and empirically assessed its accuracy and performance. Also, in simulation, we demonstrate that the algorithm scales to large networks and handles real-world deployment geometries. Finally, we show how the algorithm supports localization of mobile nodes.

  abstract  = {We present a method which enables rapid and dense
               reconstruction of scenes browsed by a single live
               camera. We take point-based real-time structure from
               motion (SFM) as our starting point, generating
               accurate 3D camera pose estimates and a sparse point
               cloud. Our main novel contribution is to use an
               approximate but smooth base mesh generated from the
               SFM to predict the view at a bundle of poses around
               automatically selected reference frames spanning the
               scene, and then warp the base mesh into highly
               accurate depth maps based on view-predictive optical
               flow and a constrained scene flow update. The
               quality of the resulting depth maps means that a
               convincing global scene model can be obtained simply
               by placing them side by side and removing
               overlapping regions. We show that a cluttered indoor
               environment can be reconstructed from a live
               hand-held camera in a few seconds, with all
               processing performed by current desktop
               hardware. Real-time monocular dense reconstruction
               opens up many application areas, and we demonstrate
               both real-time novel view synthesis and advanced
               augmented reality where augmentations interact
               physically with the 3D scene and are correctly
               clipped by occlusions.},

  abstract   = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a
                method that robots use to explore, navigate, and map
                an unknown environment. However, this method poses
                inherent problems with regard to cost and time. To
                lower computation costs, smoothing and mapping (SAM)
                approaches have shown some promise, and they also
                provide more accurate solutions than filtering
                approaches in realistic scenarios. However, in SAM
                approaches, updating the linearization is still the
                most time-consuming step. To mitigate this problem,
                we propose a submap-based approach, Tectonic SAM, in
                which the original optimization problem is solved by
                using a divide-and-conquer scheme. Submaps are
                optimized independently and parameter- ized relative
                to a local coordinate frame. During the
                optimization, the global position of the submap may
                change dramatically, but the positions of the nodes
                in the submap relative to the local coordinate frame
                do not change very much. The key contribution of
                this paper is to show that the linearization of the
                submaps can be cached and reused when they are
                combined into a global map. According to the results
                of both simulation and real experiments, Tectonic
                SAM drastically speeds up SAM in very large
                environments while still maintaining its global
                accuracy.},

  abstract   = {A robot exploring an environment can estimate its
                own motion and the relative positions of features in
                the environment. Simultaneous Localization and
                Mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these
                estimates to produce a map and a robot
                trajectory. The constraints are generally
                non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear
                optimization problem. The optimization can be
                difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising
                from odometry data, and due to the size of the state
                space. We present a fast non-linear optimization
                algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot
                trajectory, even when given a poor initial
                estimate. Our approach uses a variant of Stochastic
                Gradient Descent on an alternative state-space
                representation that has good stability and
                computational properties.We compare our algorithm to
                several others, using both real and synthetic data

                successors along the trajectory, yielding simple

                scans in order to determine the relative positions
                from which the scans were obtained, is one of the
                most heavily relied-upon tools for mobile
                robots. Current algorithms, in a trade-off for
                computational performance, employ heuristics in
                order to quickly compute an answer. Of course, these
                heuristics are imperfect: existing methods can
                produce poor results, particularly when the prior is
                weak. The computational power available to modern
                robots warrants a re-examination of these quality
                vs.  complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we
                advocate a probabilistically-motivated scan-matching
                algorithm that produces higher quality and more
                robust results at the cost of additional computation
                time. We describe several novel implementations of
                this approach that achieve real-time performance on
                modern hardware, including a multi-resolution
                approach for conventional CPUs, and a parallel
                approach for graphics processing units (GPUs). We

  abstract  = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a
               fundamental problem in mobile robotics: while a
               robot navigates in an unknown environment, it must
               incrementally build a map of its surroundings and,
               at the same time, localize itself within that
               map. One popular solution is to treat SLAM as an
               estimation problem and apply the Kalman filter; this
               approach is elegant, but it does not scale well: the
               size of the belief state and the time complexity of
               the filter update both grow quadratically in the
               number of landmarks in the map. This paper presents
               a filtering technique that maintains a tractable
               approximation of the belief state as a thin junction
               tree. The junction tree grows under filter updates
               and is periodically "thinned" via efficient maximum
               likelihood projections so inference remains
               tractable. When applied to the SLAM problem, these
               thin junction tree filters have a linearspace belief
               state and a linear-time filtering operation. Further
               approximation yields a filtering operation that is
               often constant-time. Experiments on a suite of SLAM
               problems validate the approach.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods. In addition, we highlight areas of future research potential.},

                Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem in robotics
                are superior to the more common filtering approaches
                in being exact, better equipped to deal with
                non-linearities, and computing the entire robot
                trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that
                perform map updates in constant time exist, no
                analogous smoothing method is available. We aim to
                rectify this situation by presenting a
                smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy Belief
                Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory
                and map updates in constant time except when a loop
                is closed in the environment. The SLAM problem is
                represented as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF)
                over which LBP is performed. We prove that LBP, in
                this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel relaxation
                of a linear system. The inability to compute
                marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing
                algorithm has previously been a stumbling block to
                their widespread use. LBP enables the efficient
                recovery of the marginal covariances, albeit
                approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the
                final covariances are overconfident, the ones
                obtained from a spanning tree of the GMRF are
                conservative, making them useful for data
                association. Experiments in simulation and using
                real data are presented.}

                are characterized by probability distributions whose
                factor graph representations are sparse. While there
                do exist some computationally efficient algorithms
                (e.g. incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) or
                Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE))
                for performing online incremental maximum likelihood
                estimation over these models, they generally require
                that the distribution of interest factors as a
                product of Gaussians, a rather restrictive
                assumption. In this paper, we investigate the
                possibility of performing efficient incremental
                online estimation over sparse factor graphs in the
                non-Gaussian case. Our main result is a method that
                generalizes iSAM and RISE by removing the assumption
                of Gaussian factors, thereby significantly expanding
                the class of distributions to which these algorithms
                can be applied. The generalization is achieved by
                means of a simple algebraic reduction that under
                relatively mild conditions (boundedness of each of
                the factors in the distribution of interest) enables
                an instance of the general maximum likelihood
                estimation problem to be reduced to an equivalent
                instance of least-squares minimization that can be
                solved efficiently online by application of iSAM or
                RISE. Through this construction we obtain robust,
                computationally efficient, and mathematically
                correct incremental online maximum likelihood
                estimators for non-Gaussian distributions over

Deploying multiple AUVs in formation would provide large-scale spatial and temporal data for oceanographic research. However, multi-AUV formation control is difficult because of the communication and navigation constraints of the underwater environment. The strategies we developed to address these challenges are distributed, use relative positions of neighboring vehicles to coordinate, and leverage current to increase endurance. We present simulation results for a group of 20 AUVs operating in 4D ocean currents, and compare control strategies in terms of energy expenditure and formation quality. We validated the most promising strategy with real robot experiments using three ASVs on the Charles River, and provide an initial analysis of the data.},

                layers. All cell types were modulated by running

               optimal non-linear least-squares formulation of the
               simultaneous localization and mapping problem, in
               that its maximum likelihood form matches the
               definition of the Cramer Rao Lower
               Bound. Unfortunately, computing the ML solution is
               often prohibitively expensive -- this is especially
               true during loop closures, which often necessitate
               adjusting all parameters in a loop. In this paper we
               note that it is precisely the choice of a single
               privileged coordinate frame that makes bundle
               adjustment costly, and that this expense can be
               avoided by adopting a completely relative
               approach. We derive a new relative bundle
               adjustment, which instead of optimizing in a single
               Euclidean space, works in a metric-space defined by
               a connected Riemannian manifold. Using an adaptive
               optimization strategy, we show experimentally that
               it is possible to solve for the full ML solution
               incrementally in constant time -- even at loop
               closure. Our system also operates online in
               real-time using stereo data, with fast
               appearance-based loop closure detection. We show
               results for sequences of 23k frames over 1.08km that
               indicate the accuracy of the approach}

  abstract   = {In this paper we describe a relative approach to
                simultaneous localization and mapping, based on the
                insight that a continuous relative representation
                can make the problem tractable at large
                scales. First, it is well known that bundle
                adjustment is the optimal non-linear least-squares
                formulation for this problem, in that its
                maximum-likelihood form matches the definition of
                the Cramer--Rao lower bound. Unfortunately,
                computing the maximum-likelihood solution is often
                prohibitively expensive: this is especially true
                during loop closures, which often necessitate
                adjusting all parameters in a loop. In this paper we
                note that it is precisely the choice of a single
                privileged coordinate frame that makes bundle
                adjustment costly, and that this expense can be
                avoided by adopting a completely relative
                approach. We derive a new relative bundle adjustment
                which, instead of optimizing in a single Euclidean
                space, works in a metric space defined by a
                manifold. Using an adaptive optimization strategy,
                we show experimentally that it is possible to solve
                for the full maximum-likelihood solution
                incrementally in constant time, even at loop
                closure. Our approach is, by definition, everywhere
                locally Euclidean, and we show that the local
                Euclidean estimate matches that of traditional
                bundle adjustment. Our system operates online in
                realtime using stereo data, with fast
                appearance-based loop closure detection. We show
                results on over 850,000 images that indicate the
                accuracy and scalability of the approach, and
                process over 330 GB of image data into a relative
                map covering 142 km of Southern England. To
                demonstrate a baseline sufficiency for navigation,
                we show that it is possible to find shortest paths
                in the relative maps we build, in terms of both time
                and distance. Query images from the web of popular
                landmarks around London, such as the London Eye or
                Trafalgar Square, are matched to the relative map to
                provide route planning goals.},

  abstract        = {We present a solution for optimal triangulation in three views. The solution is guaranteed to find the optimal solution because it computes all the stationary points of the (maximum likelihood) objective function. Internally, the solution is found by computing roots of multi-variate polynomial equations, directly solving the conditions for stationarity. The solver makes use of standard methods from computational commutative algebra to convert the root-finding problem into a 47 × 47 non-symmetric eigen-problem. Although there are in general 47 roots, counting both real and complex ones, the number of real roots is usually much smaller. We also show experimentally that the number of stationary points that are local minima and lie in front of each camera is small but does depend on the scene geometry. {	extcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

                vice versa) and are able to reach a solution
                quicker.  Not groundbreaking, in my opinion, but

  abstract   = {We present an algorithm for the multi-robot
                simultaneous localization and map-ping (SLAM)
                problem. Our algorithm enables teams of robots to
                build joint maps, even if their relative starting
                locations are unknown and landmarks are
                ambiguouswhich is presently an open problem in
                robotics. It achieves this capability through a
                sparse information filter technique, which
                represents maps and robot poses by Gaussian Markov
                random fields. The alignment of local maps into a
                single global maps is achieved by a tree-based
                algorithm for searching similar- looking local
                landmark configurations, paired with a hill climbing
                algorithm that maximizes the overall likelihood by
                search in the space of correspondences. We report
                favorable results obtained with a real-world
                benchmark data set.},

               potential implementors in the computer vision
               community. Bundle adjustment is the problem of
               refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly
               optimal structure and viewing parameter
               estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of
               cost function and robustness; numerical optimization
               including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent
               approximations, updating and recursive methods;
               gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The
               theory is developed for general robust cost
               functions rather than restricting attention to
               traditional nonlinear least squares.}

                of complex underwater environments. Autonomous
                underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming valuable
                tools for inspection of underwater infrastructure,
                and can create 3D maps of their environment using
                high-frequency profiling sonar. However, the quality
                of these maps is limited by the drift in the
                vehicle's navigation system. We have developed a
                technique for simultaneous localization and mapping
                (SLAM) by aligning point clouds gathered over a
                short time scale using the iterative closest point
                (ICP) algorithm. To improve alignment, we have
                developed a system for smoothing these "submaps" and
                removing outliers. We integrate the constraints from
                submap alignment into a 6-DOF pose graph, which is
                optimized to estimate the full vehicle trajectory
                over the duration of the inspection task. We present
                real-world results using the Bluefin Hovering AUV,
                as well as analysis of a synthetic data set.}

  abstract   = {Maintaining a map of an environment that changes
                over time is a critical challenge in the development
                of persistently autonomous mobile robots. Many
                previous approaches to mapping assume a static
                world. In this work we incorporate the time
                dimension into the mapping process to enable a robot
                to maintain an accurate map while operating in
                dynamical environments. This paper presents Dynamic
                Pose Graph SLAM (DPG-SLAM), an algorithm designed to
                enable a robot to remain localized in an environment
                that changes substantially over time. Using
                incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) as the
                underlying SLAM state estimation engine, the Dynamic
                Pose Graph evolves over time as the robot explores
                new places and revisits previously mapped areas. The
                approach has been implemented for planar indoor
                environments, using laser scan matching to derive
                constraints for SLAM state estimation. Laser scans
                for the same portion of the environment at different
                times are compared to perform change detection; when
                sufficient change has occurred in a location, the
                dynamic pose graph is edited to remove old poses and
                scans that no longer match the current state of the
                world. Experimental results are shown for two
                real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets,
                demonstrating the ability to maintain an up-to-date
                map despite long-term environmental changes.}

Our algorithm, termed the origin state method, enables a ‘server’ vehicle to broadcast its navigation information to multiple ‘client’ vehicles over a bandwidth-limited and faulty communication channel. The server’s broadcasted pose-graph can be used in conjunction with an estimator on the client to exactly reproduce the corresponding server–client centralized estimate. We present an evaluation over an extensive real-time field implementation of the proposed algorithm for a multi-agent autonomous underwater vehicle network using underwater acoustic modems to communicate in a synchronous-clock transmission framework.},

                KinectFusion algorithm that permits dense mesh-based
                mapping of extended scale environments in
                real-time. This is achieved through (i) altering the
                original algorithm such that the region of space
                being mapped by the KinectFusion algorithm can vary
                dynamically, (ii) extracting a dense point cloud
                from the regions that leave the KinectFusion volume
                due to this variation, and, (iii) incrementally
                adding the resulting points to a triangular mesh
                representation of the environment. The system is
                implemented as a set of hierarchical multi-threaded
                components which are capable of operating in
                real-time. The architecture facilitates the creation
                and integration of new modules with minimal impact
                on the performance on the dense volume tracking and
                surface reconstruction modules. We provide
                experimental results demonstrating the system's
                ability to map areas considerably beyond the scale
                of the original KinectFusion algorithm including a
                two story apartment and an extended sequence taken
                from a car at night. In order to overcome failure of
                the iterative closest point (ICP) based odometry in
                areas of low geometric features we have evaluated
                the Fast Odometry from Vision (FOVIS) system as an
                alternative. We provide a comparison between the two
                approaches where we show a trade off between the
                reduced drift of the visual odometry approach and
                the higher local mesh quality of the ICP-based
                approach. Finally we present ongoing work on
                incorporating full simultaneous localisation and
                mapping (SLAM) pose-graph optimisation.}

                large scale dense maps in an online setting with a
                low cost RGB-D sensor. Central to this work is the
                use of an "as-rigid-as-possible" space deformation
                for efficient dense map correction in a pose graph
                optimisation framework. By combining pose graph
                optimisation with non-rigid deformation of a dense
                map we are able to obtain highly accurate dense maps
                over large scale trajectories that are both locally
                and globally consistent. With low latency in mind we
                derive an incremental method for deformation graph
                construction, allowing multi-million point maps to
                be captured over hundreds of metres in real-time. We
                provide benchmark results on a well established
                RGB-D SLAM dataset demonstrating the accuracy of the
                system and also provide a number of our own datasets
                which cover a wide range of environments, both
                indoors, outdoors and across multiple floors.}

                 multi-vehicle Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
                 (SLAM) problem that exploits the manner in which
                 observations are fused into the global map of the
                 environment to manage the computatidnal complexity
                 of the algorithm and improve the data association
                 process. Rather than incorporating every observation
                 directly into the global map of the environment, the
                 Constrained Local Submap Filter (CLSF) relies on
                 creating an independent, local submap of the
                 features in the immediate vicinity of the
                 vehicle. This local submap is then periodically
                 fused into the global map of the environment. This
                 representation has been shown to reduce the
                 computational complexity of maintaining the global
                 map estimates as well as improving the data
                 association process. This paper examines the
                 prospect of applying the CLSF algorithm to the
                 multi-vehicle SLAM problem.},

               of robots to build joint maps without initial
               knowledge of their relative poses. The key
               contribution of this work is an optimal algorithm
               for merging (not necessarily overlapping) maps that
               are created by different robots
               independently. Relative pose measurements between
               pairs of robots are processed to compute the
               coordinate transformation between any two
               maps. Noise in the robot-to-robot observations,
               propagated through the map-alignment process,
               increases the error in the position estimates of the
               transformed landmarks, and reduces the overall
               accuracy of the merged map. When there is overlap
               between the two maps, landmarks that appear twice
               provide additional information, in the form of
               constraints, which increases the alignment
               accuracy. Landmark duplicates are identified through
               a fast nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. In order
               to reduce the computational complexity of this
               search process, a kd-tree is used to represent the
               landmarks in the original map. The criterion
               employed for matching any two landmarks is the
               Mahalanobis distance. As a means of validation, we
               present experimental results obtained from two
               robots mapping an area of 4,800 m2},

               compare. But can mention as other approaches to
               dleaing with maps from multiple robots}
